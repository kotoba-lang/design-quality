  "CLI for design-quality.audit — CI-gate ready.

     score <file-or-dir>... [--weights <edn-file>] [--skip axis1,axis2]
                            [--min <score>] [--edn|--report]

   Scans the given .html files (directories are walked recursively), scores
   each page plus the aggregate, and prints a human report (default) or EDN
   (--edn). Exits 1 when the aggregate falls below --min.

   Runs on nbb (Node) and babashka (JVM optional):

     nbb -m design-quality.cli score test/fixtures/
     bb  -m design-quality.cli score test/fixtures/*.html
     bb  score test/fixtures/*.html            ;; bb.edn task

   The engine (design-quality.audit) stays pure; all IO lives here behind
   reader conditionals (nbb: node fs, bb/clj: clojure.java.io)."
